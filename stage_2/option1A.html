 <h1>Going up the stairs</h1>
</header>
<article>
 <p>You walk up the stairs and hear how hard the staris feel. The air feels colder and colder as you walk up.
 Suddenly a loud alarm goes giving off a loud noise somewhere just beneath the stais. Just then a light turns on and you can see the 
 stairway and where it leads which seems to be up a little further to a door. It seems you triggered some kind of alarm because the noise is not stopping. You panic and
 start to run up the staris. Just then a loud boom goes off somewhere all the way downstairs. Afterwards the lights 
 go out however you managed to reach the door up the stairs. But you have a problem, you have recieved a sharp pain on your foot. You look down at 
 your foot in the now dim light and see that you are barefoot. 'Was I barefoot this whole time? How did I even get up here?' You need to make a decision if you want to continue.
