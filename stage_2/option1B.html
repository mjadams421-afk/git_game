 <h1>Going down the stairs</h1>
 </header>
<article>
 <p>You walk down the stairs and hear the creaking of the stairs. Suddenly you hear a loud alarm going off somewhere in the dark 
 in front of you. For some strange reason you decide to take your shoes off. However the alarm is getting louder and louder as you move forward. 
 'Should I go back? Why am I walking down these stairs?' Then... you hear a voice in front of you beneath the loud alarm going off. 
 Then... the alarm stops and you hear the voice clearly now. "Hello? Is anybody there? Is somebody there? please is somebody there?"
 'Oh no this was a trap. They are trying to trick me. But... why am I walking down these staris?' You need to make a decsion if you want to continue.
